Jumping Statements

1.WAP to demonstrate the use of break in a loop.
👉Write a program that prints numbers from 1 to 20, but stops the loop when it reaches 10.

2.WAP to demonstrate the use of continue.
👉Write a program that prints all even numbers from 1 to 20, skipping the odd numbers.

3.WAP using goto to create a simple menu-driven program.
👉Create a program that shows a menu, allows the user to select an option, and uses goto to loop back to the menu after performing an action.

4.WAP to print the first N natural numbers using continue to skip specific numbers.
👉Write a program that prints the first N natural numbers but skips multiples of 3.
.
5.WAP to demonstrate the usage of return in a function.
👉Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns the factorial of that number, using return to exit the function.

6.WAP to check for prime numbers using break.
👉Create a program that checks if a number is prime and exits as soon as a divisor is found using break.

7.WAP that uses goto for error handling.
👉Write a program that prompts the user to enter a positive integer and uses goto to handle invalid inputs by prompting the user again.

8.WAP to find the largest number using a loop and break.
👉Write a program that continuously takes integers as input from the user until a negative number is entered, and prints the largest number entered.

9.WAP to count digits in a number using continue.
👉Write a program that counts the number of digits in a positive integer, using continue to skip counting non-digit characters if input is taken as a string.

10.WAP to demonstrate nested loops with break and continue.
👉Create a program that prints a multiplication table, but skips the multiples of a given number using continue and breaks out of the inner loop when reaching a maximum limit.

11.WAP to find the GCD of two numbers using goto for repeated input.
👉Write a program that finds the GCD of two numbers, prompting the user to enter new numbers if either number is zero.

12.WAP to demonstrate fall through cases in a switch statement with break.
👉Create a program that takes a grade and returns a message. Include cases that fall through until a break statement is encountered.

13.WAP that uses return to exit from a function in multiple conditions.
👉Write a program that checks multiple conditions and exits the function early based on certain criteria using return.


14.WAP to demonstrate the infinite loop using goto.
👉Create a program that intentionally creates an infinite loop using goto, with a way to exit the loop based on user input.

15.WAP to demonstrate proper use of break and continue in analyzing prime numbers.
👉Write a program that finds all prime numbers in a given range, using continue to skip even numbers except for 2, and break to stop testing beyond the square root of the given number.
